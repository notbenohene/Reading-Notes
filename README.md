# What is a "growth mindset," you ask?

* A growth mindset is a frame of thinking that allows for mental flexibility, advanced learning, and continued progress. 

## Three Ways to Keep Yourself in a Growth Mindset

* Embrace Challenges: obstacles will present their selfs... and that is okay. Tango with the challenges and come out on top.
* Listen to Critque: listening to and understanding criticism allows for development that might not have been obtained through solo work
* Put in the Effort: this is (in my opinion) the _most important_ pillar of the growth mindset: you can't finish what you don't start
