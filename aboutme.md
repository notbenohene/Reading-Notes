# Gang Gang Gang

My name Ben Ohene and I like to party.

Ben is a Texas transplant residing in Seattle, Washington. He has a background in video creation, human rights, military experience (Army Army Army!), and behavior therapy, to list a few things. 

I like fruits. Mangoes, bananas, and nectarines of many varieties are my favorites. It is a dream of mine to own an orchard. I love me some GMOs. I have other interests too.
