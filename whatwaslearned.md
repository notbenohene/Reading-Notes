<span style="color:red"># This $#:+ is a bit more difficult (to me at least) than expected...</span>
but the task goes back to a pillar of the growth mindset: embrace challenges. I mean, I knew that this course was not going to be simple. Fortunately, I have an excellent instructor and knowledgable classmates (shoutout to Alejandra!) who are here with me.

I know that I am going to need to keep on top of the course material (obviously) and put forth the effort (another pillar!) in order to succeed in this class.
