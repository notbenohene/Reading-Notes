# This $#:+ is a bit more difficult (to me at least) than expected...
but the task goes back to a pillar of the growth mindset: embrace challenges. I mean, I knew that this course was not going to be simple. Fortunately, I have an excellent instructor, a good TA, and knowledgable classmates (shoutout to Alejandra!) who are here with me.

I know that I am going to need to keep on top of the course material (obviously) and put forth the effort (another pillar) in order to succeed in this class. 

Today's class material went over what to expect from the course, Markdown, uses of the terminal, various downloads, and getting acquainted with the tools that will be used throughout the program.

One bit of what was learned about today is syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting adds color to text in whichever text editor is being used. Not all text editors will have a syntax highlighting option and not everyone may be interested in the feature, but color coordinating does make coding a bit simpler to follow. This piece of information stood out to me because I had difficulty following today's instruction because my eyes got lost in the cascades of text that were being displayed. After seeing colors in the syntax, I was better able to track where I was and what I was doing.
