# This $#:+ is a bit more difficult (to me at least) than expected...
but the task goes back to a pillar of the growth mindset: embrace challenges. I mean, I knew that this course was not going to be simple. Fortunately, I have an excellent instructor and knowledgable classmates (shoutout to Alejandra!) who are here with me.

I know that I am going to need to keep on top of the course material (obviously) and put forth the effort (another pillar!) in order to succeed in this class. 


Today's class material went over what to expect from the course, Markdown, uses of the terminal, various downloads, and getting acquainted with the tools that will be used throughout the program.

Syntax highlighting adds color to text in whichever text editor is being used. Not all text editors will have a syntax hihglighting option and not everyone may be interested in the feature, but color coordinating does make coding a bit simpler to follow.
