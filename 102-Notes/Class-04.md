# Down to the Elements
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is some interesting stuff. HTML is comprised of tags that come together to display information to a viewers screen. There's a lot to it, and at the same time, not much at all. A neat thing that you can do is "inspect elements" on web pages to see what they are comprised of. A lot of letters and numbers, but it will all make sense with time.

Going to be hacking mainframes here soon.
