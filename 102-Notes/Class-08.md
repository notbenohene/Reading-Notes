# forAWhile
This class session went over operators and loops. 

- For statements repeat until a specified condition evaluates to false and are typed like this (do not forget the curly brackets):

}

- A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true and are typed, in its most basic state, like this:

while (condition)
