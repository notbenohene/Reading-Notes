# Add - Commit - Push! Three (somewhat) simple steps to make coding life easier.

Imagine the process at CMD/CTRL + S. Save your progress as you continue to advance with your projects or risk items going down the drain and end up becoming this guy:

git push origin main

Don’t forget to save progress in the VS Code platform too!
