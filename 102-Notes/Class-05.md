Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a coding language that works hand-in-hand with HTML and allows for edits on the front-end. With CSS, the appearance of a webpage can be edited to a developer’s liking (i.e. fonts, spacing, colors). There are a variety of CSS help resources available online. A good site to check out is https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/ (thanks, Kassie!) if you are in search of code to place into your CSS.
