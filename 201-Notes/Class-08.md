## Learn CSS - Flexbox Q&A

<b>1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.</b>

- Flexbox is a layout model in CSS that is designed for arranging and aligning elements in a single direction. The "one-dimensional" characterisitc of Flexbox   refers to the fact that flex containers manage their child elements along a single axis. Flexbox can produce flexible and responsive designs.


<b>2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.</b>

- Main axis: The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column.

- Cross axis: The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.

<b>3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?</b>

- Hidden Content: The ' display: none ' or ' visibility: hidden ' properties can be used to hide elements from the layout, but this can also hide content from screen readers. If critical content is hidden using flexbox properties, users with disabilities might miss important information, leading to an inaccessible experience.
