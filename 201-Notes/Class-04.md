## Creating Hyperlinks Q&A

<b>1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?</b>

- Text and other content get wrapped in < a > tags, AKA "anchor" tags.

<b>2. The href attribute contains what information?</b>

- Hypertext Reference ( href ) contain a web address. 

<b>3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?</b>

- Text that suggests that a link is present would be helpful. Also, distinguishing the link from the rest of the text by changing the link's color or font size could be beneficial.

## CSS Flow: Normal Layout and Positioning Q&A

<b>1. What is meant by “normal flow”?</b>

- Normal flow is "the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout." (Answer pulled from developer.mozilla.org)

<b>2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?</b>

- Block-level elements tend to be stacked vertically for the most part. Block-level elements also span 100% of the width of their parent element and are as tall as their child element. Inline elements get nestled within text, so they are spread horizontally and can wrap onto new lines of text in a code.

<b>3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.</b>

- Answer: Static

<b>4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.</b>

- With absolute positioning, there is precise placing of elements: exact coordinates relative to the page. Absolute positioning ia also better with responsive design flexibility. This ties in with the preciseness of element placing.

<b>5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?</b>

- "Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport." (Answer pulled from developer.mozilla.org)

## Functions: Reusable Blocks of Code Q&A

<b>1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.</b>

- Function declarations are used to define a function and specify its parameters as well as code that will be executed with it.

function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

- Function invocation takes place when using a declared function, thus triggering it to take effect.

greet("Janet");


<b>2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?</b>

- Parameter - a value that needs to included in a function's parentheses
- Argument - another name for a parameter

## Reasons for Pair Programming

<b>1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.</b>

- As the article states, "two heads are better than one."

    - Engaged collaboration - collaboration leads to learning. Learning leads to mastery.

    - Social skills - advice provided to me by individuals who have been in the tech field for a few years: be a decent coder, but be an even better people person. The tech field still has a negative stigma that portrays tech companies as glass boxes littered with anti-social weirdos. One must be the coworker that they their self would want to havee.
