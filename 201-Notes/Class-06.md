## Why is it important?

- We are diving deeper into JavaScript and learning ways to shorten processes while delivering functionality. This material digs into the subject.

## JS Object Basics Q&A

<b>1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?</b>

- An object is a collection of data that is related to each other. This object has characteristics called " properties " that define what it is.

<b>2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?</b>

- Creating object literals make the process of editing, organizing, and transferring data simpler.

<b>3. How do objects differ from arrays?</b>

- Objects can use square brackets like an array, but objects can also use what is called " dot notation" in order to access items insiddee of them.

<b>4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.</b>

- Dot notation can be easier to read, but brackets are needed if an object's property name is held in a variable.

<b>5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term " this " refer to and what is the advantage to using " this "?</b>

const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',

  age: 2,

  color: 'white with black spots',

  humanAge: function (){

    console.log( ` $ {this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years ` );

  }
  
}

- "This" refers to the current object ( dog ) that the code is written in and allows for the code to be more flexible.

## Intro to the DOM Q&A

<b>1. What is the DOM?</b>

- The Document Object Model ( DOM ) is an interface for web documents that represents a page in a way that programming languages can interact with it.

<b>2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.</b>

- JavaScript interacts with the DOM to update a webpage's content without halting the page's process.

## Things I Want to Know More About

- Nothing at the moment. That does NOT mean that I have all of this information logged and ready to go in my mind. I just don't have anything more that I want to cram right now. I am finding that it takes about 1 week for me to understand a subject. Unfortunately for me, the material does not slow down, so I am one week behind..

Still processing and learning.
