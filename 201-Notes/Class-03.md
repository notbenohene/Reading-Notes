## Ordered and Unordered Lists Q&A

<b>1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?</b>

- Unordered lists can be used when compiling a collections of items that require no sequential order

<b>2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?</b>

- The bullet style of an unordered list item can be changed using the list-style-type CSS property

<b>3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?</b>

- Ordered lists are for step-by-step directions that must be done in a particular order; imagine a cake recipe
- Unordered lists can be used when a list of items does not require a presentaton order

<b>4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?</b>

I will provide five ways to do this:

- Type ' A ' for uppercase letters
- Type ' a ' for lowercse letters
- Type ' I ' for uppercase Roman numerals
- Type ' i ' for lowercase Roman numerals
- Type ' 1 ' for numbers

## The Box Model Q&A

<b>1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?</b>

- In a way, the margin is the security guard of the box. It pushes other elements away.
- The padding can be imagined as a security guard with a jet pack that carries the box: you can't get near the box, but you can hang out "under" the box.

<b>2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.</b>

i. content - the space in the element where information is placed
ii. padding - the space between the content and the element's border (allows content under the element to be visible)
iii. border - an outline that surround the padding and content of an element
iv. margin - the space outside of an element's border

## Arrays, Operators, Expressions, Conditionals, and Loops Q&A

<b>1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?</b>

- An array is an object that can contain multiple objects. The objects can then be called upon individually when summoned. Arrays can store other arrays, booleans, numbers, objects, and strings.

<b>2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

 const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];</b>

 - The array is valid. Items can be accessed through its index number [ 0 ]

 <b>3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.</b>

 - Assignment: x = f( ) ; x = f( )
 - Multiplication: x *= f( ) ; x = x * f( )
 - Left shift: x <<= f( ) ; x = x << f( )
 - Logical AND: x && = f( ) ; x && ( x = f( ) )
 - Logical OR: x |  | = f ( ) ; x |  | ( x = f( ) )

<b>4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;</b>

 - ( 10 + false ) + 'dog' = '10dog'
 - 10 is a number, false is a boolean ( 0 ), and 'dog' is a string. 

<b>5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.</b>

- Conditional statements can be used to bolster security. If ( correct pin ) is entered, { allow access }. Else, { deny access }.

<b>6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.</b>

- Loops are useful when a task needs to be ran multiple times.
