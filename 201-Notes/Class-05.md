- A scalable vector graphic (SVG) format is ideal for when you don't want for an image to become blurry when you zoom into it.
- A graphics interchange format (GIF) is good for when you want to send a short clip of that goofy video you have showed me 5 times this week. This one tends to get blurry after it is shared multiple times.
