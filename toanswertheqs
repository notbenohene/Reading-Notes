# Four important features to look for in a text editor, according to "The Older Coder":
1.) code completion 
2.) syntax highlighting 
3.) a variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue
4.) the ability to choose from a selection of extensions 

What do the following commands do?
pwd - print working directory (pwd) displays a directory's path
ls - list files displays hidden and visible files and directories
cd - change directory allows for a useer to switch through directories in their system 
mkdir - make directory is used to create new directories
touch - touch is used to adjust the access information of a file

Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line?
(Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

cd projects - changes the directory of the folder titled "projects" 
mkdir new-project - makes a directory of a new folder
touch new-project/newfile.md - 
cd ..
ls projects/new-project
